# Project Repository

This repository contains two independent mini-projects implemented in Python using Jupyter notebooks. Each project showcases the use of data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques.

## ðŸ“„ Files

### 1. Speech_text_transcription.ipynb
- **Description**:  
  This notebook focuses on converting spoken audio input into written text using Speech Recognition technologies.
- **Key Features**:
  - Loading and processing audio files.
  - Performing speech-to-text transcription.
  - Basic text cleaning and analysis.
- **Technologies Used**:  
  Python, SpeechRecognition library, PyAudio, Google Web Speech API.

### 2. Weather_Data_Analysis_and_Prediction.ipynb
- **Description**:  
  This notebook involves analyzing historical weather data and building predictive models to forecast weather conditions.
- **Key Features**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing of weather datasets.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.
  - Machine learning models for weather prediction (Regression models).
- **Technologies Used**:  
  Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
